To register please click [here](http://research.stlouisfed.org/useraccount/register/step1). Request an API key by following the instructions [here](http://api.stlouisfed.org/api_key.html). \r\n\r\nOnce you have completed the steps above, you can now create an instance of a `FREDAPI::Client` and set your API key as appropriate:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nrequire 'fredapi'\r\napi = FREDAPI::Client.new 'api_key' => '123456789'\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you now look at your `FREDAPI` object instance it will be similar to the following:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n<FREDAPI::Client:0x007ffb89bcf3e0\r\n@adapter=:net_http,\r\n@api_endpoint=\"http://api.stlouisfed.org/\",\r\n@api_key='123456789',\r\n@file_type=\"json\",\r\n@user_agent=\"FREDAPI Ruby Gem 1.0.0\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy the default the file_type is set to `json`. This can be easily be changed by simply updating the instance variable to be set to `xml`:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\napi.file_type = 'xml'\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease note that when sending any FRED API request if you don't pass an `api_key` or `file_type` parameter the values on the `FREDAPI::Client` instance will be used as default.\r\n\r\n## Example requests\r\nNow that you have an `FREDAPI::Client` instance with your API key you can now make requests to the FRED API. For example to send a category get request do the following:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\napi.category 'category_id' => 125\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe response is returned within a `Hashie::Mash` instance.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n{\"categories\"=>[{\"id\"=>125, \"name\"=>\"Trade Balance\", \"parent_id\"=>13}]}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo find out more information about `Hashie` please visit the following link: <https://github.com/intridea/hashie>. To see all documention on the various FREDAPI endpoint method calls please visit: <http://rubydoc.info/gems/fredapi>\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\nThere are a number of unit tests which are included as part of this project, please run:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nrspec spec\r\n```\r\n      \r\nPlease note that a number of tests still need to be added so I don't currently have complete coverage, subject to workload these will be slowly added over the next few months.\r\n\r\n## Feedback\r\nI would be more than happy to recieve feedback, please email me at: jonathan.chrisp@gmail.com.\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-38101452-14","note":"Don't delete this file!
